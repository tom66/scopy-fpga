CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net nolabel_line129/adc_clk is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): nolabel_line129/asi2_mod_inst0/adc_data_rx_reg[0][7]_0, nolabel_line129/asi2_mod_inst2/adc_data_rx_reg[2][7]_0, nolabel_line129/asi2_mod_inst1/adc_data_rx_reg[1][7]_0, nolabel_line129/asi2_mod_inst4/adc_data_rx_reg[4][7]_0, nolabel_line129/asi2_mod_inst5/adc_data_rx_reg[5][7]_0, nolabel_line129/asi2_mod_inst6/adc_data_rx_reg[6][7]_0, nolabel_line129/asi2_mod_inst3/adc_data_rx_reg[3][7]_0, nolabel_line129/bufr_adc_ref_clkdiv/I, nolabel_line129/asi2_mod_inst7/adc_data_rx_reg[7][7]_0, nolabel_line129/nolabel_line132/O, nolabel_line129/nolabel_line198/rst_gen_bitslip_ctr_reg[0]_0
