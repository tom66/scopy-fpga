CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net nolabel_line173/adc_clk is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): nolabel_line173/asi2_mod_inst0/nolabel_line84_i_8_0, nolabel_line173/bufr_adc_ref_clkdiv/I, nolabel_line173/nolabel_line146/O
