CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net nolabel_line164/adc_clk is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): nolabel_line164/bufr_adc_ref_clkdiv/I, nolabel_line164/nolabel_line146/O, nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/nolabel_line79_i_8_0

There is a large setup violation of -2.470 ns between nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/ISERDESE2_adc_inst/CLKDIV (clocked by adc_data_clk) and nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/train_escape_counter_reg[2]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#997 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.470 ns between nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/ISERDESE2_adc_inst/CLKDIV (clocked by adc_data_clk) and nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/train_escape_counter_reg[3]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#998 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.470 ns between nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/ISERDESE2_adc_inst/CLKDIV (clocked by adc_data_clk) and nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/train_escape_counter_reg[4]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-16#1000 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.470 ns between nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/ISERDESE2_adc_inst/CLKDIV (clocked by adc_data_clk) and nolabel_line164/asi2_mod_inst0/train_escape_counter_reg[9]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_PL0 relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock nolabel_line144/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin nolabel_line144/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
