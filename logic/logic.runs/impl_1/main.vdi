WARNING: [Opt 31-32] Removing redundant IBUF since it is not being driven by a top-level port. nolabel_line61/inst/clkin1_ibufg 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'nolabel_line61/clk_in1' is not directly connected to top level port. Synthesis is ignored for IBUF_LOW_PWR but preserved for implementation.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1580] Phase alignment: Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 nolabel_line130/OSERDESE2_lane_d1_inst. This can result in corrupted data. The nolabel_line130/OSERDESE2_lane_d1_inst/CLK / nolabel_line130/OSERDESE2_lane_d1_inst/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
