TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock nolabel_line178/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin nolabel_line178/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

There is a large setup violation of -7.689 ns between nolabel_line178/zynq_ps/inst/PS7_i/MAXIGP1ACLK (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and nolabel_line178/FabCfg_NextGen_0/inst/FabCfg_NextGen_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg108_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 1510 control sets (vs. available limit of 13300, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
