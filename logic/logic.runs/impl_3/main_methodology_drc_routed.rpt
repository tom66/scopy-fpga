TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock nolabel_line208/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks adc_data_clk and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks adc_data_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks cfg_bram_clkb and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks cfg_bram_clkb] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks adc_data_clk and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks adc_data_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock nolabel_line208/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin nolabel_line208/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
