TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks adc_data_clk and cfg_bram_clkb are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks adc_data_clk] -to [get_clocks cfg_bram_clkb]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks adc_data_clk and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks adc_data_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -4.498 ns between nolabel_line180/R_acq_size_a_reg[12]/C (clocked by cfg_bram_clkb) and nolabel_line124/adc_axi_streamer/inst/adc_test_streamer_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/acq_axi_downcounter_reg[12]/D (clocked by adc_data_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
